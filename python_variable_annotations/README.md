# Python Variable Annotations

This project focuses on type annotations in Python 3, including function signatures and variable annotations according to the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP) 484 and 526.

## Learning Objectives

- Type annotations in Python 3
- How to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- How to validate your code with mypy

## Tasks

0. **Basic Annotations - add**: Writing a type-annotated function that takes two float arguments and returns their sum as a float.

1. **Basic Annotations - concat**: Writing a type-annotated function that takes two string arguments and returns their concatenation.

2. **Basic Annotations - floor**: Writing a type-annotated function that takes a float argument and returns its floor as an integer.

3. **Basic Annotations - to string**: Writing a type-annotated function that takes a float argument and returns its string representation.

4. **Define variables**: Defining and annotating variables with specific values and types.

5. **Complex types - list of floats**: Writing a type-annotated function that takes a list of floats and returns their sum.

6. **Complex types - mixed list**: Writing a type-annotated function that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

7. **Complex types - string and int/float to tuple**: Writing a type-annotated function that takes a string and an int or float and returns a tuple.

8. **Complex types - functions**: Writing a type-annotated function that takes a float multiplier and returns a function that multiplies a float by the multiplier.

9. **Let's duck type an iterable object**: Annotating a function that takes any iterable object and returns a list of tuples.
