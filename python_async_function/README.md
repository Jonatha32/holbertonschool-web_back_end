# Python Async Function

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using the async/await syntax, including working with asyncio and measuring performance.

## Learning Objectives

- The `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module

## Tasks

0. **The Basics of Async**: Writing an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument and waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay seconds.

1. **Let's Execute Multiple Coroutines at the Same Time with async**: Writing an async routine that spawns multiple coroutines simultaneously with the same wait time.

2. **Measure the Runtime**: Creating a function that measures the total execution time for a given coroutine.

3. **Tasks**: Writing a function that takes an integer and returns an asyncio.Task.

4. **Tasks**: Creating a function that spawns multiple coroutines using Tasks.
