# ES6 Data Manipulation

This project focuses on data manipulation techniques in ES6 JavaScript, including working with arrays, typed arrays, Sets, Maps, and other data structures.

## Learning Objectives

- How to use map, filter, and reduce on arrays
- Typed arrays in JavaScript
- The Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures
- Working with complex data structures

## Tasks

0. **Basic List of Objects**: Creating a function that returns an array of objects.
1. **More Mapping**: Using map to extract specific properties from objects.
2. **Filter**: Using filter to select objects based on specific criteria.
3. **Reduce**: Using reduce to calculate a sum from an array of objects.
4. **Combine**: Combining map and filter to update specific objects.
5. **Typed Arrays**: Working with typed arrays in JavaScript.
6. **Set Data Structure**: Using Set to store unique values.
7. **More Set Data Structure**: Implementing functions to work with Sets.
8. **Clean Set**: Creating a function to extract and join specific string values from a Set.
9. **Map Data Structure**: Using Map to create a dictionary with specific key-value pairs.
10. **More Map Data Structure**: Updating values in a Map based on specific conditions.
