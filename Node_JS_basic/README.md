This project focuses on the fundamentals of Node.js, including running JavaScript using Node.js, using Node.js modules, reading files, creating HTTP servers, and using Express.js.

## Learning Objectives

- Run JavaScript using Node.js
- Use Node.js modules
- Read files using the fs module
- Access command line arguments and environment variables
- Create a small HTTP server using Node.js
- Create a small HTTP server using Express.js
- Create advanced routes with Express.js
- Use ES6 with Node.js with Babel-node
- Use Nodemon to develop faster
