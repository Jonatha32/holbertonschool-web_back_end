# ES6 Promises

This project focuses on working with Promises in JavaScript ES6, including Promise creation, chaining, handling, and async/await.

## Learning Objectives

- Promises (how, why, and what)
- How to use the `then`, `resolve`, `catch` methods
- How to use every method of the Promise object
- Throw / Try
- The await operator
- How to use an async function

## Tasks

0. **Keep Every Promise You Make**: Creating and returning a Promise.
1. **Don't Make a Promise...If You Know You Can't Keep It**: Implementing Promise with resolve and reject.
2. **Catch Me If You Can!**: Using catch to handle rejected Promises.
3. **Handle Multiple Successful Promises**: Using Promise.all to handle multiple Promises.
4. **Simple Promise**: Creating a resolved Promise with a specific value.
5. **Reject the Promises**: Creating a rejected Promise with a specific error.
6. **Handle Multiple Promises**: Handling multiple Promises with different outcomes.
7. **Load Balancer**: Implementing a function that returns the value of the first resolved Promise.
8. **Throw Error / Try Catch**: Using try/catch blocks with Promises.
9. **Throw an Error**: Creating a function that throws an error with a specific message.
